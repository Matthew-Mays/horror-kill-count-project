This project will be an analysis of horror movie's and their kills.
Current plans are to have a kill table and a movie meta data table.
Using these I want to look into the statistics of many different things like #1 most common murder weapon, the average kills per movie, and how those statistics compare to the movies Rotten Tomatoes Score.
